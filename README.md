I used **Power BI** to analyze multiple datasets related to food delivery services. Imported multiple food delivery datasets into Power BI and performed data cleaning and transformation using the **Power Query Editor**. Merged tables using the merge query feature to consolidate relevant data from different sources for seamless analysis. Created separate slicers for Quantity and Amount to filter and analyze specific values. Examined yearly sales trends using line charts to determine whether sales have increased over time. Developed calculated measures using DAX for metrics such as Total Amount, Total Quantity, Order Count, and Rating Count. Built visualizations to gain deeper insights Bar chart to identify top cities by order volume and profit Age group analysis to determine which demographic orders food most frequently. Segmented data to understand preferences for veg vs. non-veg orders and their impact on order volume. Identified gained and lost customers year-over-year, segmented by gender (male vs. female).
